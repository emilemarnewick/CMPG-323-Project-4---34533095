# CMPG-323-Project-4 34533095

This Repository contains all the work needed for CMPG323 Project 4

As for this Project I have created an automation using UIPATH. This Automation is used to automate the tedious task af adding new Devices, Zones and Categories to the ConnectedOfficeDatabase that was provided by the lecturers.

Open the project.json file in the repository with your UI Path Community edition and you will see the whole project. 
Simply press the "run" button to start the automation. It will test the addition, deletion and editing of each Device, Zone and 
Category.
